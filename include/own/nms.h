OwnFeatureMaps:
    There are two ways of creating the feature maps, you could either call detectKeypoints and send a valid image
    or you could first call createFeatureMaps. The first method will also detect the keypoints.
    If detectKeypoints is called without an image argument and createFeatureMaps has not been called (i.e. featureMaps is empty)
    the function will throw an error.
